Working with Ether.js
create a folder > call it interacting with Smart Contracts
Create a file ether-demo.js
The in ter terminal in VS Code map the folder interacting with Smart Contracts use the command " npm init" to iniziyalize  aNEW PROPJEC
Then it will automatically create a package.json file
then use this command > npm install --save ethers to install ether.js https://docs.ethers.org/v5/getting-started/  install it with the steps below
Now inside ether-demo.js you need to import the ether package but before you do it, modify the package.json by adding type " modue at the end of the code
{
  "name": "interacting-with-smaqrt-contracts",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "etherdemo.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "ethers": "^6.6.4"
  },
  "type": "module" this one was added.
}

now modify the ether-demo.js as mentioned to import ether 
import { ethers} from "Ethers" from file ether-demo.js


2-. Then connecting to an Infura Node
Create an account and create a [roject for web 3, call it blockchainexpert or anything you want.
Get the API key.
now add it to the ether-demo.js file or code
import { ethers} from "Ethers"
const API_KEY = "0456bc6e00a845daa237beaf5f9f6c4c"
 add to the code the network that you will connect " homestead" which is basicall the mainnet in Ethereun and the provider which ins Infura this time.
 import { ethers} from "Ethers"
const API_KEY = "0456bc6e00a845daa237beaf5f9f6c4c"
const  network = "homestead"
const provider = ethers_provider.infuraProvider(network, API_KEY)
Now and the code to get the block number and log it
import { ethers} from "Ethers"
const API_KEY = "0456bc6e00a845daa237beaf5f9f6c4c"
const  network = "homestead"
const provider = ethers_provider.infuraProvider(network, API_KEY)
const blocknumber = await provider.getblocknumber();
console.log(blocknumber)
 
Then Connecting to Metamask
